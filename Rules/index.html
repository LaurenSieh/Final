                1. Clubs In Your Bag
            </h2>
                <p>
                You are allowed to carry up to 14 clubs in your bag during a competitive round. You may carry less but make sure you check the contents before you start and discard any additional ones- it can cost you a penalty stroke for every hole you play.
                </p>
            <h2>
                2. Play Within The Parameters Of The Tee
            </h2>
                <p>
                The first tee shot of a round is always daunting, even for seasoned golfer, so make sure you tee up between and behind the front of the appropriate markers.
                </p>

                3. Aviod Playing The Wrong Ball
            </h2>
                <p>
                Sounds blindly obvious but unless you mark your ball before start, there's a danger that may mistake yours for another players. Playing the wrong ball in matchplay could mean the loss of a hole in singles and will be a two stroke penalty in strokeplay. To avoid penalty, mark your ball more clearly with distinctive personalised symbols.
                </p>
            <h2>
                4. Green rulings
            </h2>
                <p>
                Once you have reached the green, there are a couple of key rules of which you need to be aware of. Once the ball comes to rest on the putting surface you may mark it with a coin, or disk, lift and clean it but remeber to replace it in the exact same spot. You may repair any pitchmarks - not just yours - other damage such as spike marks attached to the green but not on your line of putt, a playing partner's putt, or an extension of it, before the completion of the hole.
                </p>
            <h2>
                5. Play Your Ball As It Lies
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Always play your ball as it lies, wherever it comes to rest, unles the rules allow you to do otherwise. Most common exemptions include the affect of 'loose impediments'- you can remove leaves, loose twings, litter - or 'obstructions', such as man-made paths, drainage, sprinkers, from which you will recieve free reielf and be able to drop your ball within one club length at the nearest point of releif, no closer to the hole.
                </p>
            <h2>
                6. Unplayable Lies
            </h2>
                <p>
                    If your ball had comes to rest in a position that you believe to be unplayable, you have three options. Either hit another ball from the point of you previous shot, drop a ball behind the unplaybale lie - as far back as you wish keeping the orginal lie between you and the hole - or drop the ball within two club lengths either side of the unplayable lie. Each option incurs a one stroke penalty.
                </p>
            <h2>
                7. No Way Back From Out Of Bounds (OB)
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing what to do when your ball sails into out of bounds is crucial to a beginner. A ball hit beyond the confines of the course - usually marked by white stakes - must be re-played from the orginal position adding a penalty of one stroke. The scorecard of any course should have its boundaries cleary marked or described.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you believe a shot has gone OB or into a wter hazard always play a provisional and declare it. You have three minutes to search for it and if indeed it is lost you saved valuable time continuing with the provisional ball despite a one stroke penalty. If your orginal is subsequently found in bounds or dry within three minutes of the point of search you must continue with the orginal ball.
                </p>
            <h2>
                8. Seeking Advice
            </h2>
                <p>
                    While it is one of the most sociable of sports, golf is a solitary game and this is reflected with in the rules. You cannot ask advice on club selection for example from anyone other than you team mate or a caddie. Neither should you offer advice to opponents in competition. However, you may ask for information of the rules, distances or positions of hazards or the flagstick.
                </p>
            <h2>
                9. Definition Of Ball Striking
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Striking the ball would seem like a matter of technique but it is also governed in part by the rules. For instance, if you find yourself in a difficult lie within an awkward stance, you must strike the ball with the head of the club. You cannot spoon, scrape or flick it in a style that cannot be described as a stroke. A two-shot penalty in strokeplay and loss of hole in matchplay will be the outcome.
                </p>
            <h2>
                10. Score Correctly
            </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of a strokeplay round make sure you card has been completed correctly - achieved by comparing scores you have marked on playing partner's card with thise he or she has recorded. Once you agree, the card must be signed by both parties as a correct record of each hole. Addition doesn't necessarily have to be accurate but individual hole scores must tally. Incorrect scorecards, if lower socres are included, and unsigned ones will lead to disqualification.
